qubes-input-proxy for Debian
----------------------------
The input proxy provides a mechanism for isolating physical input devices from dom0.
It consists of two parts: sender and receiver.
The sender runs in a qube with physical input device attached (for example USB VM). It sends events to a listener in dom0.
The listener runs in dom0 and passes received events to an emulated device.
